## Harvard
US News Rank: [Math][1] #2(4 tied), [Analysis][2] #8(2 tied)

* [Harvard Mathematics Department Admission Info](http://www.math.harvard.edu/graduate/index.html#admission)

#### Application Deadline:  TBA

### Preparing the Application
The **statement of purpose** for graduate applications is carefully weighted by the admissions committee. The applicant's statement should convince the committee that he or she is able to communicate effectively and with a deep understanding of mathematics. It is not intended to be a biographical sketch or a reflection on one's decision to enter the field.

Three **letters of recommendation** are required. Letter writers should be faculty or others qualified to evaluate the applicant's potential for graduate study in mathematics. The letters must be submitted online and by the application deadline.

Applicants should include any **research papers, publications, and other original works** they would like to have evaluated by the admissions committee.

The department requires all applicants to submit **GRE Mathematics Subject Test** scores. Applicants should check on the ETS website for test dates in their area to insure the scores will be submitted before the application deadline. While the admissions committee reviews all applications submitted before the deadline, missing math subject test scores provide one less data point available to evaluate the application. Depending on the applicant pool and the strength of the application materials, the missing subject test scores may put the application at a disadvantage. 

The Graduate School requires scores to be submitted for the General Test of the Graduate Record Examinations (**GRE**).

Applicants whose native language is other than English and who do not hold the equivalent of a US Bachelor degree from an institution at which English is the language of instruction must submit scores from the Internet Based Test (IBT) of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (**TOEFL**).

The Graduate School requires applicants to upload an electronic copy of undergraduate **transcripts**. Hard copies of official transcripts are not required at the time of application.

#### [Personal Statement](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/personal-statement/ "link")

* What does this statement need to accomplish?
	>The personal statement should give concrete evidence of your promise as a member of the academic community, giving the committee an image of you as a person.
	This is also where you represent your potential to bring to your academic career a critical perspective rooted in a non-traditional educational background, or your understanding of the experiences of groups historically under-represented in higher education and your commitment to increase participation by a diverse population in higher education.

* What kinds of content belongs here?
	>Anything that can give reviewers a sense of you as a person belongs here; you can repeat information about your experiences in your research statement, but any experiences that show your promise, initiative, and ability to persevere despite obstacles belongs here. This is also a good place to display your communication skills and discuss your ability to maximize effective collaboration with a diverse cross-section of the academic community. If you have faced any obstacles or barriers in your education, sharing those experiences serves both for the selection process, and for your nomination for fellowships. If one part of your academic record is not ideal, due to challenges you faced in that particular area, this is where you can explain that, and direct reviewers’ attention to the evidence of your promise for higher education.

* The basic message: your academic achievement despite challenges
	>It is especially helpful for admissions committees considering nominating you for fellowships for diversity if you discuss any or all of the following:

	* Demonstrated significant academic achievement by overcoming barriers such as economic, social, or educational disadvantage;
	* Potential to contribute to higher education through understanding the barriers facing women, domestic minorities, students with disabilities, and other members of groups underrepresented in higher education careers, as evidenced by life experiences and educational background. For example,,
		* attendance at a minority serving institution;
		* ability to articulate the barriers facing women and minorities in science and engineering fields;
		* participation in higher education pipeline programs such as, UC Leads, or McNair Scholars;
	* Academic service advancing equitable access to higher education for women and racial minorities in fields where they are underrepresented;
	* Leadership experience among students from groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education;
	* Research interests focusing on underserved populations and understanding issues of racial or gender inequalities. For example,
		* research that addresses issues such as race, gender, diversity, and inclusion;
		* research that addresses health disparities, educational access and achievement, political engagement, economic justice, social mobility, civil and human rights, and other questions of interest to historically underrepresented groups;
		* artistic expression and cultural production that reflects culturally diverse communities or voices not well represented in the arts and humanities.
